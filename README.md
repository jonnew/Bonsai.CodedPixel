This repository will eventually contain a [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) package for controlling pixel-wise coded exposure cameras developed by Jack Zhang. For now the code is mixed in with the [Bonsai.OEPCIe](https://github.com/jonnew/Bonsai.OEPCIe) package in the [Prototyping project](https://github.com/jonnew/Bonsai.OEPCIe/tree/master/Bonsai.OEPCIE.Prototyping). 

TODO:
1. Separate core Bonsai.OEPCIe facilities from ephys devices and cameras
2. Make Bonsai.OEPCIe into its own Bonsai package
3. Make the officially supported Open Ephys devices into its own Bonsai Package
4. Bring the Pixel Coded Exposure devices into this repo and make it into a Bonsai Package.
